# Swipenav

A standalone script written for mobile devices. The purpose of this script is to add functionality to mobile sites by allowing a quick way to navigate back and forward between pages.

The only requirements are that you use the correct meta viewport tag, otherwise the swipenav will be activated and the page itself will scroll sideways.

A demo can be found at http://beeldenmedia.nl/voorbeelden/mobiele-gebruikers-sneller-laten-navigeren/swipenav.html

## Installation

Place the following meta data and the css in the head

	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">
	<link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" href="swipenav.css">

Place the js at the bottom of the body and you are ready to go

	<script src="swipenav.js"></script>
